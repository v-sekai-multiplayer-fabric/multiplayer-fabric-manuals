title: "Maglev Cycle 11: CockroachDB Score Write"
date: 2026-05-06
status: proposed
tier: baseline
---

## The Context

With causal ordering confirmed in Cycle 10 and the DB connection verified in Cycle 4, Cycle 11 activates persistence: the persona zone commits the score and `multiplayer-fabric-uro` writes it to CockroachDB.

## The Problem Statement

The cross-zone write path — persona zone commits, uro writes via Ecto over Fly's 6PN using the `gateway_writer` role — requires end-to-end validation. With causal ordering confirmed in Cycle 10, the only remaining unknown is whether the database write path performs correctly under mission load.

## Design

On each core-slot event the persona zone commits the score update after the `VClock.le` check passes. On mission end `multiplayer-fabric-uro` writes the committed score to CockroachDB via Ecto over Fly's 6PN using the `gateway_writer` role. `RelReplica` entries stamped with `sentAt` are broadcast to the interest band.

Write path:

```
spatial zone  →  QueueOp(VClock)  →  persona zone commits
              →  uro → CockroachDB (gateway_writer, Fly 6PN)
              →  RelReplica(sentAt) broadcast to interest band
```

Pass criteria:

- [ ] Committed score appears in CockroachDB within one tick of mission end
- [ ] `RelReplica.stale` correctly reflects the write on all nodes in the interest band
- [ ] No write occurs from any zone other than the persona authority

## Estimate

**5 days** (2026-06-30 → 2026-07-07). The Ecto write path to CockroachDB is proven in Cycle 4; the work is the persona zone commit flow, VClock gating on the write side, and RelReplica broadcast. No prior end-to-end causal write exists in the history.

## CRIS Score

| Factor          | Score | Evidence                                                                                                       |
| --------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **C**omplexity  | 6     | The Ecto write path to CockroachDB over Fly's 6PN under concurrent mission load is untested in this codebase.  |
| **R**each       | 10    | Persistent player progression requires this path.                                                              |
| **I**mpediment  | 8     | A broken score write does not block Cycle 10 gameplay but blocks any feature that depends on persistent state. |
| **S**takeholder | 10    | Required for the full Maglev Intercept scenario.                                                               |
| **Total**       | 8.0   | Build after Cycles 10 and 9 pass.                                                                              |

## The Downsides

If the persona zone goes down, that player's attributes are offline until it recovers. Replication factor ≥ 2 on the persona partition is the mitigation, deferred to a later cycle.

## The Road Not Taken

Writing scores directly from the spatial zone to CockroachDB was considered. Rejected — it violates `DisjointRanges` and allows concurrent writes to the same player record.
