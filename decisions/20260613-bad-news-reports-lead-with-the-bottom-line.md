## Context and Problem Statement

A status report carries an outcome the reader acts on: a slipped date, a broken
build, a failed smoke. A report that opens with progress and buffers the outcome to
the end makes the reader scan for the catch before the report says anything they can
use. How does a report in this project phrase an outcome the reader needs first?

## Decision Drivers

- A reader who learns the outcome in the first sentence starts deciding on it
  immediately, rather than after a paragraph of buildup.
- An executive or on-call reader scans the opening line and stops; the rest is there
  for whoever needs the why.
- The rule stays mechanical enough to apply in review without debate.
- Urgency — a down service, a failed gate — leaves no room for a warm-up.

## Considered Options

- Indirect approach: open with a progress buffer, then state the outcome.
- Direct approach (bottom line up front): state the outcome first, then the
  explanation, then the next step.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "the direct approach", because the reader holds the outcome before the
explanation, so the explanation reads as context rather than as suspense, and a reader
who needs only the outcome stops after one line.

A status report carries three parts in order:

- **Bottom line.** The first sentence states the outcome plainly — the slip, the
  failure, the result — with no buffer, no apology, and no warm-up. A reader who reads
  only this line knows where the work stands.
- **Explanation.** The factual reason for the outcome follows. The reader already holds
  the outcome, so the explanation carries the why without holding the result back.
- **Next step.** The report closes on what happens next: the fix underway, the
  alternative open to the reader, or the time of the next update.

The voice rules out two habits:

- A progress buffer that opens on what went well and defers the outcome to the end.
- An apology or hedge in place of the outcome in the first sentence.

A good outcome takes the same shape: the first sentence states the result, and the
rest carries the why and the next step.

### Consequences

- Good, because the reader decides on the outcome from the first line instead of
  scanning for it.
- Good, because one shape covers a slip, a failed gate, and a shipped result alike.
- Good, because an urgent report — a down service, a recall — leads with the fact that
  drives the response.
- Bad, because the opening reads blunt, and an author used to a buffer needs practice
  to drop it.

### Confirmation

Review checks that a status report opens on its outcome, with the explanation and the
next step after it, and no progress buffer or apology ahead of the bottom line.
