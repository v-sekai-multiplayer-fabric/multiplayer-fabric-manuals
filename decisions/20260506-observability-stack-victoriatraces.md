title: Replace Jaeger with VictoriaTraces for trace storage

## Context

Jaeger all-in-one with Badger storage was chosen as the Apache 2.0 replacement for Tempo. VictoriaMetrics ships VictoriaTraces — an Apache 2.0 trace backend that accepts OTLP directly. VictoriaMetrics benchmarks report 3.7× less RAM and 2.6× less CPU vs Tempo.

Using VictoriaTraces puts all three storage backends (metrics, logs, traces) under the same vendor, drops Badger's single-node limit, and matches the port and CLI-flag conventions already in use.

## Decision

Replace Jaeger all-in-one with VictoriaTraces in the single-machine observability stack.

- VictoriaTraces listens on 10428 (HTTP, UI + query + OTLP HTTP ingest).
- OTEL Collector exports traces via `otlphttp/traces` to `http://localhost:10428/insert/opentelemetry`.
- Data persists at `/var/lib/victoriatraces` on the shared Fly volume.
- Jaeger is removed entirely; no separate query UI process is needed.

Port map after this change:

| Service         | Port                     | Purpose                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| VictoriaMetrics | 8428                     | Metrics storage and PromQL       |
| VictoriaLogs    | 9428                     | Log storage and query            |
| VictoriaTraces  | 10428                    | Trace storage and query          |
| OTEL Collector  | 4317 (gRPC), 4318 (HTTP) | OTLP ingest, routes to the above |

## Consequences

- All four services are now Apache 2.0; the three storage backends are from VictoriaMetrics.
- VictoriaTraces query UI is at `http://...:10428/select/vmui`.
- `fly proxy 10428:10428` replaces the former `fly proxy 16686:16686` for trace inspection.
- No explicit trace TTL is configured; add `-retentionPeriod` if disk pressure becomes a concern.
