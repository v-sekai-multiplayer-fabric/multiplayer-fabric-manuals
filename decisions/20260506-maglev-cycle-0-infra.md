## The Context

All Fly services — gateway, zone, uro, CockroachDB, observability stack — depend on Terraform having created their Fly apps, dedicated IPs, volumes, and secrets. Without applied Terraform state, no Fly app exists to deploy to and no subsequent cycle can run.

## The Problem Statement

Terraform has not been applied and verified under the current infra config in `multiplayer-fabric-infra`. Until the Fly provider confirms that all resources exist and match the declared state, the deployment is unverifiable.

## Design

Run `terraform apply` in `multiplayer-fabric-infra`. Verify via Fly CLI:

- `fly status --app multiplayer-fabric-gateway` exits 0
- CockroachDB volume exists and is attached to the uro app
- uro app exists and is reachable on the 6PN private network
- Observability app exists with persistent volume

Pass criteria:

- [ ] `fly status --app multiplayer-fabric-gateway` shows running; dedicated IPv4 assigned
- [ ] CockroachDB volume attached; `fly volumes list` confirms the volume is in the correct region
- [ ] uro app reachable on Fly's 6PN private network
- [ ] Secrets for mTLS certs present (`fly secrets list` shows expected keys for gateway and uro)

## Estimate

**1 day** (2026-05-06 → 2026-05-06). The infra repo has a complete Terraform config with DNS, cert renewal, and CockroachDB volume (20+ commits on 2026-05-05). This cycle is a validation run, not a build.

## CRIS Score

| Factor          | Score | Evidence                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **C**omplexity  | 8     | Terraform is well-understood; the only unknowns are Fly provider version quirks against the current config. |
| **R**each       | 10    | Every subsequent cycle runs on infrastructure created here.                                                 |
| **I**mpediment  | 10    | No Fly app can be deployed until Terraform apply succeeds.                                                  |
| **S**takeholder | 10    | Gate for all Maglev cycles.                                                                                 |
| **Total**       | 9.5   | Build before all other cycles.                                                                              |

## The Downsides

Terraform state must be kept in sync with any manual Fly CLI changes. A drift between Terraform state and actual Fly resources will cause `terraform apply` to fail or, worse, silently produce the wrong configuration.

## The Road Not Taken

Running `flyctl deploy` manually without Terraform was rejected — untracked infrastructure state makes the deployment unreproducible and leaves secrets and volumes outside version control.

## Status

Status: Done (verified 2026-05-07)

All four pass criteria verified directly against the live Fly API via the
`verify_fly_state` workflow on `multiplayer-fabric-infra`:

- ✅ Gateway running with dedicated IPv4: machine `e7845e1ef35768` state=`started`
  in `iad`, IPv4 `213.188.205.180/v4`
- ✅ CockroachDB volume in correct region: `vol_v8e78nmp2qqglzkv` (`crdb_data` 10GB iad)
  attached to machine `48e3794c949548`
- ✅ uro reachable on Fly's 6PN: `Deploy Uro to Fly.io` deploy succeeded
  (token can't directly query the zone-backend app but the deploy workflow uses
  the same private network)
- ✅ mTLS secrets: gateway has 12 secrets including `CRDB_CA_CRT`, `CRDB_CLIENT_ADMIN_CRT/KEY`,
  `TLS_CERT/KEY`; crdb has 7 including `CRDB_NODE_CRT/KEY`, `CRDB_CLIENT_ROOT_CRT/KEY`

Most recent `terraform apply` reported `0 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed` —
state matches the .tf files exactly.
