## Context and Problem Statement

The capabilities table lists features with a free-text status ("working", "loses
about 90%"). Free text does not say whether a feature is a throwaway experiment, a
committed part of the product, or a nice-to-have. The team needs one shared
vocabulary for how far along and how committed a feature is, so planning and the
docs agree on what "done" means for each one.

## Decision Drivers

- One vocabulary shared between planning and the manuals.
- A reader should know at a glance whether a feature is committed or exploratory.
- Cheap to apply and to move as a feature matures.

## Considered Options

- Keep free-text status only.
- A maturity ladder (alpha / beta / stable).
- A three-tier commitment classification: proof of concept, baseline, stretch.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "A three-tier commitment classification", because it captures
commitment, not just maturity, which is what planning needs.

The tiers:

1. **Proof of concept** — demonstrates the idea works end to end, in partial or
   throwaway form. May be unreliable or lossy, and nothing depends on it yet.
2. **Baseline** — the committed minimum the product ships. Works reliably across
   the target platforms. This is the bar.
3. **Stretch goal** — beyond baseline. Pursued if time allows; cutting it does not
   block the release.

Each feature in the [capabilities table](../index.md#capabilities-and-where-they-live)
carries one tier. A feature moves between tiers as it matures or as commitment
changes; the tier is the current call, not a permanent label.

### Initial triage

- Native video playback — baseline.
- Scene baking via OpenUSD — baseline.
- Spatial audio (HRTF + audio probes) — baseline.
- Speech — baseline.
- Pen stroke creation (cassie) — proof of concept (patch surface creation loses
  about 90%).

### Consequences

- Good: planning and docs share one word per feature for its commitment level.
- Good: the tier is a small, reversible edit as features move.
- Bad: a tier is a judgement call and can drift from reality if the table is not
  kept current.

### Confirmation

The capabilities table has a Tier column, and every row carries one of the three
tiers. New capabilities are added with a tier.
