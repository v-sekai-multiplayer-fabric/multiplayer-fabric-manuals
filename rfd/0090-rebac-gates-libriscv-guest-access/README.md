title: "RFD 0090: ReBAC gates libriscv guest access, not five callbacks"
rfd: "0090"
state: discussion
scope: zone-guest-middleham, godot-sandbox-style libriscv hosts
---

## Problem

`rfd/0079` picked raw `libriscv` for sandboxed guest code (now living in
`zone-guest-middleham`), but never defined what host capabilities a
guest may reach. `rfd/0079`'s own "Consequences" section says so
directly: "The exact `GodotInstance`/scene API `godot_tick` uses to
apply entity input and read state back out is not yet nailed down."

`godot-sandbox`, the reference `libriscv`-Godot integration, already
solved this once, with five independent allow-callbacks: class, object,
method, property, and resource. Each callback returns a plain boolean.
None of the five shares state with the others, and none returns a
reason or a path a reviewer could audit later.

## Decision

Gate guest access through ReBAC, not five separate callbacks, and not
a two-tier core/user split like `godot-luau-script`'s. Reuse the
working ReBAC engine already vendored in this ecosystem:
`thirdparty/taskweft-nif/standalone/tw_rebac.hpp`'s `TwReBACGraph`, or
its Lean-proved cousin, `lean-rebac-core`'s `ReBAC.lean`.

Model each guest `libriscv::Machine` instance as a ReBAC subject.
Model each of `godot-sandbox`'s five gated things (a class, an object,
a method, a property, a resource path) as a ReBAC object. Replace each
boolean callback with one `check_expr`/`can()` call: does this guest
subject have `HAS_CAPABILITY` (or a defined computed relation) to this
object. Grant access by adding edges (`HAS_CAPABILITY`, `CONTROLS`,
`DELEGATED_TO`), not by writing a new callback per axis.

Also gate `libriscv`'s own execution-budget primitives (instruction-
counted timeout, pause/resume) as ReBAC actions, not hardcoded
constants. Budget extension becomes an authorized relationship: a
supervisor or owner grants more gas, checked the same way as any
other capability.
